These are various Schematic Circuits for building Guitar Effects - Stompboxes/Footpedals, etc...- found on the internet or from electronic mgazines. 

Most have been modified in various ways. 
Just some circuits I've found useful and widely used by others.
Compiled for Convenience !

Some people use a Positive and Negative Power Supply (See the Buck-Boost MultiVolt circuit), while others use a Single Supply (+9 or +12 volts DC) then a "rail splitter" or "1/2 VCC" , which I call "Vref" , also known as Vr, 1/2VCC, Vb, etc....

The Klon Centaur Clone, with the circuit/value changes, had been built and verified working. I built an SMD version, which I may put up for sale later. It sounds Great!

The PT2399 Delay circuits have a lot of noise associated with this IC - not much can be done about it. It is best to keep the Delay short to minimize this noise. There are some circuits that add a compressor/expandor. Research and experiemnt.

The key is to breadboard and experiment !
